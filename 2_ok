a man thinks that the president is a fool
a man thinks that he wants a coca-cola 
a boy thinks that he thinks
a boy sees that a man thinks
a boy sees that an apple is on the table
a boy sees that the man is the president
a boy sees that a bird eats the flies
a man sees that a boy sees a bird
a man thinks that he is the president
the president thinks that he is a president
the flies think that the birds eat the flies
he thinks that he thinks that he thinks
he thought that the president thinks that he ate the sandwich
he thinks that the sandwich is on the table
the birds see that the flies are red flies
