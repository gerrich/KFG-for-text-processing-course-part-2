he ate the sandwich that lay on the table
he ate the sandwich that the president wanted
a president is a man that is a fool
a red apple is an apple that lies on the table
a boy sees the sandwich that the president sees
a man that the president sees is the president
a bird eats an apple that lies on the table that is in the garden
a president thinks about an apple that is on the table
a president sees an apple that is on the table in the garden
a man that is the president is in the garden
a boy that is the boy with an apple that is a red apple is in the garden
a man that is in the garden eats an apple
the table that is in the garden is the giant table
the garden that is the giant garden is his garden
the president in the garden that is giant garden is the man with an apple
