he eats an apple and a sandwich
he eats an apple , a sandwich and a bird
a man and a boy , the president and the bird eat the flies  
he thinks , thinks and thinks
the birds eat , eat and eat
an apple is very very very red apple
every every apple is very very red apple
a man and a boy are on the table
a man , a boy and a table are on the floor
a man is on the floor and thinks about the table
the president eats an apple , an apple , an apple and an apple
a very very giant man and the president walk in the garden
a boy saw the birds and the flies
an apple and a hat lie on the table
a bird and the flies are in the garden
